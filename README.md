# code-quiz

This project is a basic coding quiz challenge containing six questions. If the user answers correctly, a point will be added to their score. When an answer is incorrect or if submit is pressed without answer selection, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. Local storage is used to store user initial's and score at the end of the game.
